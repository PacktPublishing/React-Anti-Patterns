# The Code Oven: Where Pizzas and Programming Blend

![The code oven application](/mockups/code-oven.png)

## Get started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/abruzzi/code-oven.git
cd code-oven
yarn install
```

To launch the application in your local:

```shell
yarn start
```

## Run the unit tests / integration tests

```shell
yarn test
```

When doing TDD, you normally should have a terminal to watch and run your tests while you're making code changes. You can do that in your IDE, but I 
found it useful to have a full-screen terminal on another monitor, especially when I have to see some error messages like an element cannot be found among HTML text wall.

## Run end-to-end tests

```shell
yarn run e2e
```
