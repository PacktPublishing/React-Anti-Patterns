Combining Data Fetching Strategies and Error Handling & Loading with a discussion about React Query can make for a compelling section. React Query essentially unifies these concerns into a singular, more manageable API, which can be a great demonstration of how to simplify complex tasks in real-world React applications.

Here's how you might structure this combined section:

### Data Fetching and State Management with React Query

#### Traditional Data Fetching with `useEffect`
- Introduce the basics of data fetching using `useEffect` and Axios or the Fetch API.
- Discuss common patterns for handling loading states and errors.

##### Example: Basic `useEffect` Data Fetching

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  setLoading(true);
  fetch('/api/data')
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => setData(data))
    .catch((error) => setError(error))
    .finally(() => setLoading(false));
}, []);
```

#### Introducing React Query

- Explain what React Query is and how it simplifies data fetching, caching, and state management.

##### Example: React Query Simplification

```jsx
const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery('fetchData', fetchFunc);
```

#### Benefits of React Query

- Automatic retries
- Data caching
- Better error handling
- Loading state management

#### React Query in Practice
- Provide a side-by-side comparison of how code that used to require 20-30 lines with `useEffect` can be reduced to a few lines with React Query.
- Discuss real-world use-cases where React Query shines, such as pagination, infinite loading, and background data fetching.

By approaching it this way, you're not just presenting problems and solutions in isolation, but also offering a comparison that enables the reader to fully appreciate the value of using a library like React Query. This should make the topics not just educational but also immediately actionable for your readers.
